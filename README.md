# Project Overview
This repository analyses landslide events in **Turkey** using the **NASA Global Landslide Catalog** (Python). It explores how different triggers—particularly rainfall—relate to **fatalities**, **seasonality**, and **event frequency**.

# Objectives
- **Clean & classify** the NASA dataset ()
- **Analyse seasonality** ()
- **Compare impact by trigger** ()
- **Identify spatial hotspots** ()

# Data & Tools
- Data: NASA Global Landslide Catalog (CSV)
- Python: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy ()

# Reproducibility
- Open the notebook and run cells top-to-bottom?
- Replace the input CSV with the latest export if needed?

- # Key Findings *(to update after running the notebook)*
- **Seasonality:** ~**X%** of rain-related landslides and **Y%** of fatalities occurred during **Jun–Sep (monsoon period)** in Turkey’s rain-driven events.?
- **Trigger impact:** **Downpour** events showed **higher mean fatalities per event** (≈ **A**), compared to **Rainfall** (≈ **B**) — confirmed by **Kruskal–Wallis** (p = **P**).?
- **Hotspots:** Districts such as **[District 1]**, **[District 2]** recorded the **highest event density** and **fatality burden**.?
- **Event size & impact:** **[Large/Very large]** landslides, though less frequent, accounted for **Z%** of total fatalities.?
- **Reporting note:** Data coverage ends around **2018** for many regions; results reflect reporting bias and should be interpreted accordingly.?
