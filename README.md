# Project Overview
This repository analyses landslide events in **Turkey** using the **NASA Global Landslide Catalog** (Python). It explores how different triggers—particularly rainfall—relate to **fatalities**, **seasonality**, and **event frequency**.

# Objectives
- **Clean & classify** the NASA dataset ()
- **Analyse seasonality** ()
- **Compare impact by trigger** ()
- **Identify spatial hotspots** ()

# Data & Tools
- Data: NASA Global Landslide Catalog (CSV)
- Python: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy ()

# Reproducibility
- Open the notebook and run cells top-to-bottom?
- Replace the input CSV with the latest export if needed?
- 

- # Key Findings 
- **Seasonality:** Most events happen in July-Nov (midsummer-autumn) , but Jan(mid-winter) events are deadlier per landslide **
- 
- **Trigger impact:** **Downpour** Downpours are the leading cause of landslides in Turkey, both in terms of frequency (11 events) and lethality (median 3 fatalities per event, maximum 12**
- 
- **Hotspots:** NE Turkey provinces (Rize–Artvin) are hotspots, with rainfall-induced slides causing repeated fatalities**.?
- 
- **Event size & impact:** ?
- 
- **Reporting note:** ?
