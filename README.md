# Project Overview
This repository analyses landslide events in **Turkey** using the **NASA Global Landslide Catalog** with Python. It explores how different triggers—particularly rainfall—relate to **fatalities**, **seasonality**, and **event frequency**.

# Data & Tools
- Data: NASA Global Landslide Catalog (CSV)
- Python 3.12.11


# Reproducibility
  ## Requirements & Installation
  This project was developed and tested with:
  - pandas 2.2.2
  - numpy 2.0.2
  - matplotlib 3.10.0
  - plotly 5.20.0
  - python-dateutil 2.9.0.post0

    To ensure reproducibility, a `requirements.txt` file is included in this repository. This allows anyone to recreate the same environment and run the code reliably.

          ### Option A: Clone repo (requires Git)
          git clone https://github.com/geodata-p/Turkey_Landslide_analysis_NASA_Data.git
          cd Turkey_Landslide_analysis_NASA_Data
          pip install -r requirements.txt

          ### Option B: Download ZIP (no Git required)
          - Click the green “Code” button on GitHub → Download ZIP
          - Extract the folder
          - Open terminal/Anaconda Prompt and run:
          cd path/to/Turkey_Landslide_analysis_NASA_Data
          pip install -r requirements.txt



# Objectives
NASA data cleaning → filtering Turkey → analysis → insights
- **Clean & classify** the NASA dataset
 ### Data Ingestion
The NASA Global Landslide Catalog (CSV) was uploaded into Google Colab using  a pandas (data analysis library, for loading and manipulating CSVs). 





- **Analyse seasonality** ()
- **Compare impact by trigger** ()
- **Identify spatial hotspots** ()









- # Key Findings 
- **Seasonality:** Most events happen in July-Nov (midsummer-autumn) , but Jan(mid-winter) events are deadlier per landslide **
- 
- **Trigger impact:** **Downpour** Downpours are the leading cause of landslides in Turkey, both in terms of frequency (11 events) and lethality (median 3 fatalities per event, maximum 12**
- 
- **Hotspots:** NE Turkey provinces (Rize–Artvin) are hotspots, with rainfall-induced slides causing repeated fatalities**.?
- 
- **Event size & impact:** ?
- 
- **Reporting note:** ?
